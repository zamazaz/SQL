#For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the top five artists and ordered them by popularity.
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 5;

#Second I determined the top 10 songs and ordered them by popularity.
SELECT track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#Then I determined the song with the most danceability. 
SELECT track_name, MAX(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name;

#Lastly I determined the songs with average duration and ordered them by artist and track name.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;
